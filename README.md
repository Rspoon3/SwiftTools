## About 
I find myself using a lot of the same extensions and views in each of my projects. It started to become tedious keeping track of which projects I updated these in. By consolidating everything into this package the aim is to reduce time spent managing project files, and more time creating awesome things.

## Installation 

### Swift Package Manager (Preferred)
Since Xcode integrated swift package manager natively into the IDE you can add SFSymbol simply by:

**`File`-> `Swift Packages` -> `Add Package Dependency...`**

when prompted to enter a package URL paste: 

`https://github.com/Rspoon3/SwiftTools` 


and click next & finish to automagically install SwiftTools through Xcode & SPM!

### Manual 
Don't want that additional third party dependency? Then just simply copy over the files into your project's appropriate folder!
